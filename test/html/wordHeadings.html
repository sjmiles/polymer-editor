  <h3>MS Word headings example</h3>
  This example shows how in MS Word, Headings should be followed by other
  styled content. Eg the the "next paragraph style" differs based on the
  paragrph the user is on. For the purpose of this test, we simply create
  a normal paragraph after a heading. But ultimately each heading can have
  it's own style and thereby dictate what style the next node should be.
  This could easily be achieved with either dedicated css or data binding
  on the heading element.
